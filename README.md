# Textual Sentiment Analysis and Steganography Detection

**Unveiling Hidden Messages in Reviews**  
This project combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Steganography** to analyze online textual reviews for sentiment and detect potential hidden (steganographic) messages embedded within them.

## üß† Project Overview

The notebook `NLP_STEGNORGRAPH_Final.ipynb` presents an experimental pipeline that:

1. Performs **sentiment analysis** on review texts using NLP techniques.
2. Applies **steganography detection** to uncover if any suspicious or hidden information is embedded within natural language reviews.

The aim is to explore how everyday-looking textual reviews could potentially be used as carriers for covert communication while still serving as valid user feedback.

## üßπ NLP Preprocessing Steps

To prepare the text data for analysis, the following NLP preprocessing techniques were applied:

- **Lowercasing** ‚Äì Normalize text for uniformity.
- **Tokenization** ‚Äì Split reviews into individual words or tokens.
- **Stopword Removal** ‚Äì Eliminate common words that don't add much meaning (like *is*, *the*, *and*).
- **Lemmatization** ‚Äì Reduce words to their base or root form (e.g., *running* ‚Üí *run*).
- **Punctuation Removal** ‚Äì Clean unnecessary characters.
- **Vectorization** ‚Äì Convert text into numerical format using methods like TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.
