# Textual Sentiment Analysis and Steganography Detection

**Unveiling Hidden Messages in Reviews**  
This project combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Steganography** to analyze online textual reviews for sentiment and detect potential hidden (steganographic) messages embedded within them.

## üß† Project Overview

The notebook `NLP_STEGNORGRAPH_Final.ipynb` presents an experimental pipeline that:

1. Performs **sentiment analysis** on review texts using NLP techniques.
2. Applies **steganography detection** to uncover if any suspicious or hidden information is embedded within natural language reviews.

The aim is to explore how everyday-looking textual reviews could potentially be used as carriers for covert communication while still serving as valid user feedback.
